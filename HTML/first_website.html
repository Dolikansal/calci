        <h3>Introduction to c++</h3>
        <p>C++is a powerful general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s. C++ is widely used for system/software development, game development, and applications that require high performance.</p>
        <h4>Feature of c++</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Object-Oriented: C++ supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, allowing for the creation of classes and objects. This helps in organizing code and promoting reusability.</li>
            <li>Rich Standard Library: C++ provides a rich set of built-in functions and libraries, which can significantly reduce the development time.</li>
            <li>Portability: C++ programs can be compiled and run on various platforms without significant modifications.</li>
            <li>Compatibility with C: C++ is compatible with C, allowing for the integration of existing C code.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Basic syntax</h4>
        <pre style="background-color: aqua;">
            #include &lt; iostream &gt;

                using namespace std;
                 
                int main() {
                    cout &lt; &lt; "Hello, World!" &gt; &gt; endl;
                     return 0;
                }    
        </pre>
        <ul>
            <li>#include &lt; iostream &gt; This includes the input/output stream library, allowing the use of cout for output and cin for input.</li>
            <li>using namespace std;: This line allows access to the standard library features without prefixing them with std::</li>
            <li>int main(): The entry point of every C++ program..</li>
            <li>cout: Used for outputting data to the console.</li>
            <li>return 0;: Indicates that the program has ended successfully.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Application of c++</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>System Software: C++ is used in developing operating systems and system-level applications.</li>
            <li>Game Development: Many game engines and games are written in C++ due to its performance and control over system resources.</li>
            <li>Embedded Systems: C++ is often used in programming embedded systems for devices like smartphones, appliances, and automotive systems.</li>
            <li>Web Browsers: Many web browsers, like Google Chrome, use C++ for performance-critical components.</li>
        </ol>

         <h3>Introduction to array</h3>
         <h5>what is an array</h5>
         <p>An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, typically of the same data type. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, which allows for efficient data management and manipulation.</p>
         <img src ="Arrays.webp" height = 300>
         <h3>Characteristics of Arrays</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Fixed Size: The size of an array is defined when it is created and cannot be changed.</li>
            <li>Indexed: Each element in an array is accessed using an index, which typically starts from 0.</li>
            <li>Homogeneous Elements: All elements in an array must be of the same data type, such as integers, floats, or strings.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Types of Arrays</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>One-Dimensional Arrays: A linear list of elements, where each element can be accessed by a single index</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: int numbers[5]; (stores 5 integers)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Multi-Dimensional Arrays: Arrays with more than one dimension, commonly used for matrices and tables</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: int matrix[3][3]; (a 3x3 matrix of integers)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Dynamic Arrays: Arrays that can change size during program execution, typically implemented using data structures like lists.</li>
         </ol>
